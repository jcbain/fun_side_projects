# A Python Hacker's guide to Neural Networks 
## A **Python 3** Adaptation to Andrej Karpathy's [Hacker's guide to Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)

A Python 3 flavored guide to Andrej Karpathy's killer JavaScript tutorial, which can be found [here](http://karpath.github.io/neuralnets/). This is a work in progress and progress can be stalled due to PhDing.
